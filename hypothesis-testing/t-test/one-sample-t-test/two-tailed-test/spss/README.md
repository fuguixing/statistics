# One Sample T Test

## Software requirements

IBM SPSS 2.5

## Use case

The life X of electronic components in a factory obeys the normal distribution. Now, the life of 18 components is measured as follows, which is as shown in data-two-tailed.txt,

Question: Is there any reason to think that the average life of components is more than 210 hours? (α= 0.05)

## Results

H0 : μ≤ 210
H1 : μ＞ 210

P=sig(2-tail)/2 = 0.632/2 = 0.316

0.316 > 0.05, we accept H0 and reject H1

So, there is no reason to think that the average life of components is more than 210 hours
