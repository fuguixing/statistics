    "Students' academic performance is related to the teaching methods of teachers. A teacher at a school adopted a new and effective teaching method. After one academic year of teaching, six students' test scores were randomly selected from the class taught by the teacher, which were 48.5, 49.0, 53.5, 49.5, 56.0, and 52.5, respectively. The score is 52.0. Try to analyze whether there is a significant difference in the scores of students who use this teaching method and those who do not use the new teaching method (known test results obey normal distribution, take α = 0.05)"
