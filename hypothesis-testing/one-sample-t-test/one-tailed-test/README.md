# One Sample T Test

## Software requirements

IBM SPSS 2.5

## Use case

A factory uses an automatic packing machine to pack the containers. Under normal circumstances, the standard weight of each box is 100. One day, after the factory starts operation, 12 boxes are randomly selected for testing. The weight is as shown in data-one-tailed.txt,

Question: Is the packaging machine working properly? (α= 0.05)

## Results

H0 : μ＝ 100
H1 : μ≠ 100

sig(2-tail) = 0.188

0.188 > 0.05, we can accept H0 and reject H1

So, the packaging machine is working properly
