    "In a kindergarten, 49 children were tested with Binet intelligence test (σ = 16) when they entered the kindergarten. The average intelligence quotient was X1 = 106. One year later, the same group of subjects were tested again. The result was x2 = 110. The correlation coefficient of the two test results was known to be r = 0.74. Can you say that the children's intelligence quotient increased significantly with the age and one year's education. (alpha =0.01)"
